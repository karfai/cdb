* work queue
** TODO (BUG) cannot end a trip if there are no upcoming pickups while waiting at a Stop
** DONE "hildonize"
   CLOSED: [2009-12-03 Thu 19:03]
** DONE set_bridge() and Bridge creation should be in Model, poll()'d items should go through Model on the way to the UI objects
   CLOSED: [2009-12-12 Sat 13:21]
** DONE State.next() runs prev_state.finish(), new_state.start() before returning, this means that during Panel.next(), the current State in Panel will be prev_state(). A new State method, active() should be created to execute when the State is actually the current State.
   CLOSED: [2009-11-07 Sat 18:25]
** DONE If coupling b/w Bridge and the UI layer is removed, then Model can be extended as a caching layer to improve queries or provide better interactivity based on already queried data for the State
   CLOSED: [2009-12-12 Sat 13:21]
** TODO another state: NearbyStops shown when waiting for buses (WaitAtStop); it should show Stops within 400m and act much like StopSearch w/o the location entry
** TODO In StopSearch State, selecting a stop should show which routes serve the stop in a SelectedDetails (Label) widget
** DONE Stop.upcoming_pickups() should not list pickups for routes which terminate @ the current stop
   CLOSED: [2009-12-12 Sat 20:51]
** TODO Upcoming Stops displayed while riding should be time-offset based on the different b/w now() and the 
   expected pickup time. This assumes that the inter-stop travel time in the schedule is consistent even if
   the pickup is late.
** DONE While riding, if a Stop is the last stop for the trip, show an indication.
   CLOSED: [2009-12-12 Sat 20:51]
** DONE persist search history
   CLOSED: [2009-12-12 Sat 20:24]
** DONE There's something odd going on w/Timers on the device - are they cancelled at the correct time?
   CLOSED: [2009-11-07 Sat 17:52]
** In the Search Panel, show info text under the list which list the routes servicing the stop when an item is selected
** DONE track down synchro. issues in current threading approach
   CLOSED: [2009-10-15 Thu 19:25]
** DONE keep search history in search location box
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 20:25]
** DONE storm is probably not available on maemo, so redo schema in pure sqlite
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 18:49]
** DONE search in the gtk gui
   CLOSED: [2009-09-07 Mon 01:43]

** DONE "riding" state
   CLOSED: [2009-09-07 Mon 14:51]

** DONE loop the riding state back to the waiting-at-stop state
   CLOSED: [2009-09-07 Mon 15:06]

** DONE add ability to end the trip while waiting at a stop, this should return to the search panel
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 19:50]
** DONE each state can provide a name for the transition button
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 19:50]
** DONE allow for multiple exit points (buttons) from a panel
   CLOSED: [2009-09-19 Sat 19:50]
** DONE implement a background thread which runs the sqlite queries
   CLOSED: [2009-10-08 Thu 19:02]

* concepts
** If we want to track the intentions of the rider, we should try to import data from the travel planner or allow them to input their intended route. This might allow the server-side of the equation to show how rider's intentions deviate from reality.
** Places; Trips I take; saved place-to-place routing
** how should "getting to the stop" be represented?
** adhoc recording to the travelog?
