** TODO "hildonize"
** TODO set_bridge() and Bridge creation should be in Model, poll()'d items should go through Model on the way to the UI objects
** TODO State.next() runs prev_state.finish(), new_state.start() before returning, this means that during Panel.next(), the current State in Panel will be prev_state(). A new State method, active() should be created to execute when the State is actually the current State.
** TODO 
** TODO Stop.upcoming_pickups() should not list pickups for routes which terminate @ the current stop
** TODO Upcoming Stops displayed while riding should be time-offset based on the different b/w now() and the 
   expected pickup time. This assumes that the inter-stop travel time in the schedule is consistent even if
   the pickup is late.
** TODO While riding, if a Stop is the last stop for the trip, show an indication.
** TODO persist search history

* concepts
** If we want to track the intentions of the rider, we should try to import data from the travel planner or allow them to input their intended route. This might allow the server-side of the equation to show how rider's intentions deviate from reality.
